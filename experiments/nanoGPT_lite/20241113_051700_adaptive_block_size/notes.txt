# Title: Adaptive Block Size: Dynamic Context Window Adjustment for Efficient Training
# Experiment description: Modify the model to dynamically adjust its block size during training, starting with a smaller block size and gradually increasing it. This could potentially lead to faster initial training and better long-range dependency learning.
