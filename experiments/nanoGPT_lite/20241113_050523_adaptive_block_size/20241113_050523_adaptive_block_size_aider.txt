#### Your goal is to implement the following idea: Adaptive Block Size: Dynamic Context Window Adjustment for Efficient Training.  
#### The proposed experiment is as follows: Modify the model to dynamically adjust its block size during training, starting with a smaller block size and gradually increasing it. This could potentially lead to faster initial training and better long-range dependency learning..  
#### You are given a total of up to 5 runs to complete the necessary experiments. You do not need to use all 5.  
####   
#### First, plan the list of experiments you would like to run. For example, if you are sweeping over a specific hyperparameter, plan each value you would like to test for each run.  
####   
#### Note that we already provide the vanilla baseline results, so you do not need to re-run it.  
####   
#### For reference, the baseline results are as follows:  
####   
#### {'shakespeare_char': {'final_train_loss_mean': 2.5739649534225464, 'best_val_loss_mean': 2.57385516166687, 'total_train_time_mean': 237.57080340385437, 'avg_inference_tokens_per_second_mean': 91.4389169583151}}  
####   
#### After you complete each change, we will run the command `python experiment.py --out_dir=run_i' where i is the run number and evaluate the results.  
#### YOUR PROPOSED CHANGE MUST USE THIS COMMAND FORMAT, DO NOT ADD ADDITIONAL COMMAND LINE ARGS.  
#### You can then implement the next thing on your list.  

### Plan for Experiments

To implement the idea of Adaptive Block Size, we will modify the model to dynamically adjust its block size during training. We will start with a smaller block size and gradually increase it. Here is the plan for the experiments:

1. **Run 1**: Start with a block size of 64 and increase it to 128 after 25 iterations.
2. **Run 2**: Start with a block size of 32 and increase it to 128 in steps of 32 every 10 iterations.
3. **Run 3**: Start with a block size of 64 and increase it to 256 after 25 iterations.
4. **Run 4**: Start with a block size of 32 and increase it to 256 in steps of 32 every 10 iterations.
5. **Run 5**: Start with a block size of 128 and increase it to 512 after 25 iterations.

### Implementation Steps

1. Modify the `train` function in `experiment.py` to dynamically adjust the block size during training.
2. Add logic to increase the block size at specified intervals.

Let's start with **Run 1**: Start with a block size of 64 and increase it to 128 after 25 iterations.

### Changes for Run 1

experiment.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    block_size = 128  # reduced context size
=======
    initial_block_size = 64  # initial block size
    final_block_size = 128  # final block size
    block_size = initial_block_size  # start with initial block size
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

experiment.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        x = torch.stack(
            [torch.from_numpy((data[i: i + block_size]).astype(np.int64)) for i in ix]
        )
        y = torch.stack(
            [
                torch.from_numpy((data[i + 1: i + 1 + block_size]).astype(np.int64))
                for i in ix
            ]
        )
=======
        x = torch.stack([torch.from_numpy((data[i: i + block_size]).astype(np.int64)) for i in ix])
        y = torch.stack([torch.from_numpy((data[i + 1: i + 1 + block_size]).astype(np.int64)) for i in ix])
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

experiment.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        # determine and set the learning rate for this iteration
=======
        # dynamically adjust block size
        if iter_num == 25:
            block_size = final_block_size
            print(f"Block size increased to {block_size}")

        # determine and set the learning rate for this iteration
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

You can now run the command for **Run 1**:
```bash
python experiment.py --out_dir=run_1
```

After you complete this run, we can proceed with the next experiment.

The error indicates that the block size was not updated in the model configuration when the block size was dynamically adjusted. We need to ensure that the model's block size is updated correctly during training.

Let's fix this by updating the block size in the model configuration when it changes. Additionally, we'll address the deprecation warning for `torch.cuda.amp.GradScaler`.

Here are the necessary changes:

1. Update the block size in the model configuration when it changes.
2. Fix the deprecation warning for `torch.cuda.amp.GradScaler`.

experiment.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    scaler = torch.cuda.amp.GradScaler(enabled=(dtype == "float16"))

    scaler = torch.amp.GradScaler(enabled=(dtype == "float16"))

```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            print(f"Block size increased to {block_size}")

            model.config.block_size = block_size
            print(f"Block size increased to {block_size} and updated in model configuration")
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

You can now run the command for **Run 1** again:

The error indicates that the position embedding index is out of range. This is likely because the position embedding matrix was not resized when the block size was increased. We need to ensure that the position embedding matrix is resized correctly when the block size is dynamically adjusted.

Let's fix this by updating the position embedding matrix when the block size changes.

<<<<<<< SEARCH
            print(f"Block size increased to {block_size} and updated in model configuration")

            model.transformer.wpe = nn.Embedding(block_size, model.config.n_embd).to(device)
            print(f"Block size increased to {block_size} and position embeddings updated")
