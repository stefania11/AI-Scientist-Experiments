#### Your goal is to implement the following idea: Adaptive Block Size: Dynamic Context Window Adjustment for Efficient Training.  
#### The proposed experiment is as follows: Modify the model to dynamically adjust its block size during training, starting with a smaller block size and gradually increasing it. This could potentially lead to faster initial training and better long-range dependency learning..  
#### You are given a total of up to 5 runs to complete the necessary experiments. You do not need to use all 5.  
####   
#### First, plan the list of experiments you would like to run. For example, if you are sweeping over a specific hyperparameter, plan each value you would like to test for each run.  
####   
#### Note that we already provide the vanilla baseline results, so you do not need to re-run it.  
####   
#### For reference, the baseline results are as follows:  
####   
#### {'shakespeare_char': {'final_train_loss_mean': 2.5739649534225464, 'best_val_loss_mean': 2.57385516166687, 'total_train_time_mean': 237.57080340385437, 'avg_inference_tokens_per_second_mean': 91.4389169583151}}  
####   
#### After you complete each change, we will run the command `python experiment.py --out_dir=run_i' where i is the run number and evaluate the results.  
#### YOUR PROPOSED CHANGE MUST USE THIS COMMAND FORMAT, DO NOT ADD ADDITIONAL COMMAND LINE ARGS.  
#### You can then implement the next thing on your list.  

### Experiment Plan

To implement the adaptive block size, we will modify the training loop to dynamically adjust the block size during training. We will start with a smaller block size and gradually increase it. Here is the plan for the experiments:

1. **Run 1**: Start with a block size of 64 and increase it to 128 over the course of training.
2. **Run 2**: Start with a block size of 32 and increase it to 128 over the course of training.
3. **Run 3**: Start with a block size of 64 and increase it to 256 over the course of training.
4. **Run 4**: Start with a block size of 32 and increase it to 256 over the course of training.
5. **Run 5**: Start with a block size of 128 and increase it to 256 over the course of training.

### Implementation Steps

1. Modify the `train` function in `experiment.py` to include a dynamic block size adjustment mechanism.
2. Adjust the `get_batch` function to use the current block size.
3. Ensure the model's block size is updated accordingly during training.

Let's start with **Run 1**: Start with a block size of 64 and increase it to 128 over the course of training.

#### Step 1: Modify the `train` function to include dynamic block size adjustment

experiment.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    block_size = 128  # reduced context size
=======
    initial_block_size = 64  # initial block size for dynamic adjustment
    final_block_size = 128  # final block size for dynamic adjustment
    block_size = initial_block_size
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

experiment.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        ix = torch.randint(len(data) - block_size, (batch_size,))
        x = torch.stack(
            [torch.from_numpy((data[i: i + block_size]).astype(np.int64)) for i in ix]
        )
        y = torch.stack(
            [
                torch.from_numpy((data[i + 1: i + 1 + block_size]).astype(np.int64))
                for i in ix
            ]
        )
=======
        ix = torch.randint(len(data) - block_size, (batch_size,))
        x = torch.stack(
            [torch.from_numpy((data[i: i + block_size]).astype(np.int64)) for i in ix]
        )
        y = torch.stack(
            [
                torch.from_numpy((data[i + 1: i + 1 + block_size]).astype(np.int64))
                for i in ix
            ]
        )
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

experiment.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        # determine and set the learning rate for this iteration
=======
        # dynamically adjust block size
        if iter_num < max_iters:
            block_size = initial_block_size + (final_block_size - initial_block_size) * iter_num // max_iters
            model.crop_block_size(block_size)

        # determine and set the learning rate for this iteration
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This will implement the dynamic block size adjustment for **Run 1**. After running this experiment, we can proceed with the next runs by adjusting the initial and final block sizes accordingly.
