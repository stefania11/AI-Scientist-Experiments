#### Your goal is to implement the following idea: Adaptive Block Size: Dynamic Context Window Adjustment for Efficient Training.  
#### The proposed experiment is as follows: Modify the model to dynamically adjust its block size during training, starting with a smaller block size and gradually increasing it. This could potentially lead to faster initial training and better long-range dependency learning..  
#### You are given a total of up to 5 runs to complete the necessary experiments. You do not need to use all 5.  
####   
#### First, plan the list of experiments you would like to run. For example, if you are sweeping over a specific hyperparameter, plan each value you would like to test for each run.  
####   
#### Note that we already provide the vanilla baseline results, so you do not need to re-run it.  
####   
#### For reference, the baseline results are as follows:  
####   
#### {'shakespeare_char': {'final_train_loss_mean': 2.5739649534225464, 'best_val_loss_mean': 2.57385516166687, 'total_train_time_mean': 237.57080340385437, 'avg_inference_tokens_per_second_mean': 91.4389169583151}}  
####   
#### After you complete each change, we will run the command `python experiment.py --out_dir=run_i' where i is the run number and evaluate the results.  
#### YOUR PROPOSED CHANGE MUST USE THIS COMMAND FORMAT, DO NOT ADD ADDITIONAL COMMAND LINE ARGS.  
#### You can then implement the next thing on your list.  

### Plan for Experiments

To implement the idea of adaptive block size, we will modify the model to start with a smaller block size and gradually increase it during training. We will conduct a series of experiments to test different strategies for adjusting the block size. Here is the plan for the experiments:

1. **Run 1**: Start with a block size of 64 and increase it to 128 after 25% of the training iterations.
2. **Run 2**: Start with a block size of 64 and increase it to 128 after 50% of the training iterations.
3. **Run 3**: Start with a block size of 64 and increase it to 128 after 75% of the training iterations.
4. **Run 4**: Start with a block size of 32 and increase it to 128 in steps of 32 every 25% of the training iterations.
5. **Run 5**: Start with a block size of 32 and increase it to 128 in steps of 32 every 50% of the training iterations.

### Implementation Steps

1. Modify the `train` function in `experiment.py` to include logic for adjusting the block size during training.
2. Add a helper function to adjust the block size based on the current iteration.
3. Update the training loop to call this helper function at the appropriate intervals.

Let's start with **Run 1**.

### Changes for Run 1

#### Step 1: Add a helper function to adjust the block size

experiment.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    # training loop
=======
    # Helper function to adjust block size
    def adjust_block_size(iter_num, model, initial_block_size, final_block_size, change_iter):
        if iter_num == change_iter:
            print(f"Adjusting block size from {initial_block_size} to {final_block_size}")
            model.crop_block_size(final_block_size)
            model.config.block_size = final_block_size

>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

#### Step 2: Update the training loop to call the helper function

experiment.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        # determine and set the learning rate for this iteration
=======
        # Adjust block size at 25% of max_iters
        adjust_block_size(iter_num, model, 64, 128, max_iters // 4)

        # Determine and set the learning rate for this iteration
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

#### Step 3: Initialize the model with the initial block size

experiment.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    block_size = 128  # reduced context size
=======
    block_size = 64  # initial context size for adaptive block size experiment
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

With these changes, we can run the first experiment using the command:

```bash
python experiment.py --out_dir=run_1
```

Please run the command above to execute the first experiment. Once the results are available, we can proceed with the next experiment.

#### AssertionError  

The error indicates that the `block_size` being set in the `adjust_block_size` function is greater than the initial `block_size` set in the model configuration. To fix this, we need to ensure that the initial `block_size` in the model configuration is set to the maximum `block_size` we plan to use during training.

Additionally, we need to update the deprecated `torch.cuda.amp.GradScaler` usage.

Let's make the necessary changes:

1. Set the initial `block_size` in the model configuration to 128.
2. Update the `torch.cuda.amp.GradScaler` usage.

### Changes

#### Step 1: Set the initial `block_size` in the model configuration to 128

experiment.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    block_size = 64  # initial context size for adaptive block size experiment
=======
    block_size = 128  # initial context size for adaptive block size experiment
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

#### Step 2: Update the `torch.cuda.amp.GradScaler` usage

experiment.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    scaler = torch.cuda.amp.GradScaler(enabled=(dtype == "float16"))
=======
    scaler = torch.amp.GradScaler(enabled=(dtype == "float16"))
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Please apply these changes and re-run the experiment using the command:

```bash
python experiment.py --out_dir=run_1
```
